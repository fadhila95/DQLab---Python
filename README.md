DQLab â€“ Python Data Analysis Projects  

A collection of Python learning projects completed as part of DQLabâ€™s Data Analyst learning path.  
These projects focus on mastering Python fundamentals for data analysis â€” including data structures, data manipulation with Pandas, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  

## ðŸ“˜ **Projects List**

### 1. Sequential Data Structure  
* Learned basic Python data structures such as *list*, *dictionary*, *tuple*, and *set*.  
* Performed core operations: element access, data updates, looping, and built-in method applications.  

### 2. Condition, Looping, & Function  
* Implemented *conditional statements* (ifâ€“elifâ€“else), *loops* (for & while), and *functions*.  
* Utilized *arguments*, *default arguments*, and *return values* to create modular and efficient code.  

### 3. Pandas Data Manipulation  
* Introduction to Pandas library: *Series* and *DataFrame*.  
* Performed *data extraction, selection, sorting, aggregation,* and *summarization* for early dataset exploration.  

### 4. Handling Missing Data & Data Cleaning  
* Executed comprehensive *data cleaning* to ensure high-quality datasets.  
* Addressed *missing values, duplicates, outliers,* and standardized inconsistent data formats.  
* Implemented *data insertion* into Google BigQuery.  

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
* Conducted analysis on the *Telco Customer Churn* dataset using visualizations such as *donut chart*, *boxplot*, and *scatter plot*.  
* Identified *outliers*, *missing values,* and correlations between variables.  
* Explored numerical and categorical distributions to uncover meaningful insights.  

## ðŸ§  **Tools & Libraries Used**
* Python (Google Colab)  
* Pandas  
* NumPy  
* Matplotlib  
* Seaborn

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Objective**
These projects aim to strengthen Python-based data analysis skills and build a complete understanding of *data wrangling, cleaning,* and *exploratory visualization* as essential steps before advanced analytics or modeling.  

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Learnings**
* Understanding Python data structures  
* Building modular and reusable functions  
* Cleaning and transforming datasets  
* Creating informative visualizations  
* Extracting data-driven insights for decision making
